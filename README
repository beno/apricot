Fork to get it to install. Changes are brute force monkeypatches by a non-Java person, so don't try this at home.

    cd build/
    mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
    cd product/
    ./build.sh
    cd target/ecr-default
    ./run.sh

It installs and starts but returns only 404s for now. So there.
